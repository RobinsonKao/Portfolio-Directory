- [Python](#python)

## SQL <a name="sql"></a>
| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| [üõç E-Commerce Retail Sales Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Online%20Retail%20Sales%20Project) | EDA & Data Transformation | In this project, I leveraged SQL queries to analyze product popularity, seasonal revenue trends, top-selling items, monthly and regional sales patterns, customer spending behaviors, and customer lifetime value (CLV). The insights gained could inform strategies for inventory management, customer retention, and personalized marketing efforts. |
| [üöö DataCo Global Supply Chain Analysis Project](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/DataCo%20Supply%20Chain%20Performance%20and%20Analysis%20Project) | Data Transformation, Data Wrangling, EDA | This project involved analyzing revenue across product categories, customer segments (consumer, corporate, home office), and regions. I used SQL queries to examine customer behavior in response to varying discount rates and shipping efficiency differences across regions. The goal was to uncover actionable insights into revenue generation, geographical sales patterns, customer segmentation, and shipping performance. |



## Tableau <a name="tableau"></a>
| Project Link | Project Description |
|--------------|---------------------|
| [üë©üèª‚Äçüíª E-Commerce Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/OnlineRetailSalesDashboard_17141246193480/Dashboard1) | Developed an interactive dashboard displaying key metrics, including month-to-month revenue, cost of goods sold, customer lifetime value (CLV) profitability, seasonal revenue share, average purchase value by country, and a revenue heatmap by country, based on queried data from the e-commerce retail sales EDA project. |
| [üìä DataCo Global Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/SupplyChainPerformanceAnalyticsDashboard/Dashboard1) | Designed an analytical dashboard showcasing key metrics‚Äîyearly revenue, net profit, top-selling and most-cancelled product categories, delivery timeliness, and revenue distribution across customer segments and countries‚Äîusing data from the DataCo supply chain analytics project.



## Python <a name="python"></a>
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| [üíµ Global Data Scientist Salary Forecasting](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Project) | Data Wrangling, EDA, Machine Learning Modeling | This project develops a machine learning model to predict global salaries for data science roles, considering factors like experience, location, and employment type to provide insights into compensation trends and areas for improvement. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction%20Project) | Machine Learning Modeling | This project involves building three machine learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis) to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties and sensory ratings. The dataset includes 4,898 white wines and 1,599 red wines from northern Portugal, with quality scores ranging from 0 to 10. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib |
| [ü¶† Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Project) | Data Wrangling, Data Transformation, EDA, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Visualization & Modeling | This project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and both supervised and unsupervised modeling to test the hypothesis that higher death rates are correlated with increased first-dose vaccination rates, suggesting that rising death rates may drive urgency for vaccination. | Pandas, Sklearn, GeoPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy |
