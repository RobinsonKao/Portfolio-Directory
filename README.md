# üó∫ Robinson's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Here, I document a summary of my projects in the data field.

## üìö Table of Contents
- [SQL](#sql)
- [Tableau](#tableau)
- [Python](#python)

## SQL <a name="sql"></a>
| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| [üõç E-Commerce Retail Sales Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Online%20Retail%20Sales%20Project) | EDA & Data Transformation | Utilized SQL queries to extract insights on product popularity, seasonal revenue, top-selling items, sales trends by month and country, customer spending habits, and customer lifetime value. These insights enable informed inventory management and personalized marketing strategies, enhancing overall business performance. |
| [üöö DataCo Global Supply Chain Analysis Project](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/DataCo%20Supply%20Chain%20Performance%20and%20Analysis%20Project) | Data Transformation, Data Wrangling, EDA | This project involved a detailed analysis of the revenue generated through different product categories, customer segments (consumer, corporate, home office), and countries/regions of the world. In addition, I wrote queries to probe customer behavior in response to varying discount rates on products, and shipping efficiency differences for different regions of the world. The goal was to uncover actionable insights into revenue generation, geographical sales patterns, customer segmentation, and shipping performance. |



## Tableau <a name="tableau"></a>
| Project Link | Project Description |
|--------------|---------------------|
| [üë©üèª‚Äçüíª E-Commerce Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/OnlineRetailSalesDashboard_17141246193480/Dashboard1) | Developed an interactive dashboard featuring key metrics such as month to month revenue, cost of goods sold, CLV profitability, seasonal revenue share, average purchase value by country, and a revenue per country heatmap based on queried results from online retail sales EDA project. |
| [üìä DataCo Global Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/SupplyChainPerformanceAnalyticsDashboard/Dashboard1) | Designed an analytic dashboard with aggregated statistics on the company's yearly revenue, net profit, highest selling/most cancelled product categories, delivery timeliness, and the distribution of revenue from different customer segments and countries.



## Python <a name="python"></a>
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| [üíµ Global Data Scientist Salary Forecasting](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Project) | Data Wrangling, EDA, Machine Learning Modeling | This project develops a machine learning model to predict global salaries for data science roles, considering factors like experience, location, and employment type to provide insights into compensation trends and areas for improvement. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction%20Project) | Machine Learning Modeling | This project involves building three machine learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis) to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties and sensory ratings. The dataset includes 4,898 white wines and 1,599 red wines from northern Portugal, with quality scores ranging from 0 to 10. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib |
| [ü¶† Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Project) | Data Wrangling, Data Transformation, EDA, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Visualization & Modeling | This project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and both supervised and unsupervised modeling to test the hypothesis that higher death rates are correlated with increased first-dose vaccination rates, suggesting that rising death rates may drive urgency for vaccination. | Pandas, Sklearn, GeoPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy |
