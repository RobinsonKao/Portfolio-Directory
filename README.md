# üó∫ Robinson's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Here, I document a summary of my projects in the data field.

## üìö Table of Contents
- [SQL](#sql)
- [Tableau](#tableau)
- [Python](#python)

## SQL <a name="sql"></a>
| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| [üõç E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Online%20Retail%20Sales%20Project) | EDA & Data Transformation | Utilized SQL queries to extract insights on product popularity, seasonal revenue, top-selling items, sales trends by month and country, customer spending habits, and customer lifetime value. These insights enable informed inventory management and personalized marketing strategies, enhancing overall business performance. |
| [üöö DataCo Supply Chain Performance and Analysis Project](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/DataCo%20Supply%20Chain%20Performance%20and%20Analysis%20Project) | Data Transformation, Data Wrangling, EDA | This project involved a detailed analysis of the revenue generated through different product categories, customer segments (consumer, corporate, home office), and countries/regions of the world. In addition, I wrote queries to probe customer behavior in response to varying discount rates on products, and shipping efficiency differences for different regions of the world. The goal was to uncover actionable insights into revenue generation, geographical sales patterns, customer segmentation, and shipping performance. |



## Tableau <a name="tableau"></a>
| Project Link | Project Description |
|--------------|---------------------|
| [üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Online Retail Sales Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/OnlineRetailSalesDashboard_17141246193480/Dashboard1) | Developed an interactive dashboard featuring key metrics such as month to month revenue, cost of goods sold, CLV profitability, seasonal revenue share, average purchase value by country, and a revenue per country heatmap based on queried results from online retail sales EDA project. |
| [üìä DataCo Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robinson.kao/viz/SupplyChainPerformanceAnalyticsDashboard/Dashboard1) | Designed an analytic dashboard with aggregated statistics on the company's yearly revenue, net profit, highest selling/most cancelled product categories, delivery timeliness, and the distribution of revenue from different customer segments and countries.



## Python <a name="python"></a>
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| [üíµ Global Data Scientist Salary Forecasting](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20Project) | Data Wrangling, EDA, Machine Learning Modeling | This project develops a machine learning model to predict salaries for data science roles globally. By analyzing factors like experience level, location, and employment type, it provides insights into compensation and areas for improvement. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction%20Project) | Machine Learning Modeling | In this project, I constructed three different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis) that predict the quality of wine with the chosen dataset which contains the physicochemical properties and sensory ratings of 4898 white wines and 1599 red wines from the north of Portugal. The goal is to predict the quality of the wine, which is scored between 0 and 10. | Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels API, NumPy, Matplotlib |
| [ü¶† Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/RobinsonKao/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Covid-19%20Data%20Project) | Data Wrangling, Data Transformation, EDA, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Visualization & Modeling | In this project, I conducted lengthy EDA, supervised, and unsupervised modeling to assess my running hypothesis which posits a positive correlation between changes in death rates and first-dose vaccination rates. It suggests that higher death rates could drive increased urgency for vaccination. | Pandas, Sklearn, GeoPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy |
